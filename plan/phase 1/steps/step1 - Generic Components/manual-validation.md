# Step 1: Generic Components - Manual Validation

## Overview

This document outlines the manual testing and validation procedures that must be performed by human testers to ensure the Generic Components meet quality standards. These tests complement the automated validation and focus on user experience, visual design, and edge cases that automated tests cannot fully cover.
