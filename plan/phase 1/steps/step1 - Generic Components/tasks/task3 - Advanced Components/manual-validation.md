- [ ] Escape key consistently closes overlays

### Screen Reader Testing

**Test Procedures:**
1. Test with NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver
2. Check ARIA attribute announcements
3. Test dynamic content announcements
4. Verify role and state announcements
5. Check landmark navigation

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] All content is properly announced
- [ ] ARIA attributes provide correct information
- [ ] Dynamic changes are announced
- [ ] Component roles are clear
- [ ] Navigation landmarks are available

## Performance Manual Testing

### Animation Performance Testing

**Test Procedures:**
1. Test animations on various devices
