# Step 4: Automatic Validation

## Checks

- Build: Angular app compiles without errors
- Unit tests: analytics events for CTA/WhatsApp present (extend where needed)
- Lint/format: follow repository standards if configured
- JSON-LD: basic schema presence snapshot test (optional)

## Notes

- Prefer small, focused tests that assert event emission and reduced-motion behavior is respected.
