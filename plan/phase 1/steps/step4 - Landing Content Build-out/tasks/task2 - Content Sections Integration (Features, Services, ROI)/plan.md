# Task 2: Content Sections Integration (Features, Services, Conversion)

## Goal

Integrate and polish Features, Services, and Conversion Calculator sections using i18n copy and existing components.

## Subtasks

- Source copy from `landing-copy-context.md` and `public/assets/i18n/*.json`
- Verify services and features cards use Angora combos; no hardcoded colors
- Ensure Conversion calculator labels and options localized; analytics events fire on changes
- Respect reduced motion for any transitions within these sections

## Deliverables

- Sections display finalized copy for EN/ES
- Conversion interactions tracked and validated
