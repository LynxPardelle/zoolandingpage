# Task 2: Content Sections Integration - Changelog

## Changes

- LandingPageComponent: features and services switched from static signals to computed values reactive to LanguageService (ES/EN variants)
- Preserved existing analytics hooks: services `services_cta_click`, ROI `roi_size_change` and `roi_industry_change`
- Left ROI template strings in ES for now; marked for future localization

## Validation

- ng serve: Application compiled and started locally
- Verified features/services content now reacts to language toggles
- No hardcoded colors introduced; styling remains via Angora utility classes
