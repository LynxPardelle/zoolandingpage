# Task 1: Hero & Messaging

## Goal

Implement and refine the hero section content and layout using i18n copy, ensuring accessibility, responsive layout, and reduced-motion behavior.

## Subtasks

- Source headline/subcopy/CTA labels from i18n (`public/assets/i18n/*.json`) aligned with `docs/landing-copy-context.md`
- Ensure hero animations are guarded by MotionPreferenceService
- Verify Angora combos/classes used for spacing and layout (no hardcoded colors)
- Track CTA clicks via AnalyticsService (already in place; validate)

## Deliverables

- Updated hero with finalized copy for EN/ES
- Validation notes updated; minimal unit tests if copy-driven selectors change
