# Step 4: Manual Validation

## Visual & Content

- Verify hero headline and subcopy match docs/landing-copy-context.md (EN/ES)
- Check responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints
- Confirm services/features and Conversion sections render expected copy and layouts

## Accessibility

- Screen-reader: headings hierarchy, landmarks, alt text
- Keyboard: tab order, focus states visible, skip link works
- Reduced motion: set OS pref and validate subdued animations

## Analytics & Conversion

- Click Final CTA primary/secondary → events recorded
- Click WhatsApp button → `whatsapp_click` recorded and opens intended action
- Interact with Conversion controls → events recorded (size/industry changes)

## Structured Data

- Validate JSON-LD via Rich Results Test (copy-paste rendered markup)
