# Task 1: Automatic Validation

- Unit tests for theme toggle persistence (localStorage keys)
- Unit tests for language toggle persistence and label changes (ES/EN)
- Ensure production build passes budgets (no regressions)
- Header nav labels react to LanguageService state without page reload
- No SSR hydration warnings related to theme/language services
