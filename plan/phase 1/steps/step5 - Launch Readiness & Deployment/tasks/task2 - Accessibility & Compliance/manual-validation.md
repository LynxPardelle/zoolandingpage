# Task 2: Accessibility & Compliance â€” Manual Validation

- Keyboard-only: Can traverse all interactive elements, focus is always visible
- Skip link: Appears on focus, moves focus to `#main-content`
- Landmarks: `header[role=banner]`, `main[role=main]`, `footer`
- Mobile nav: Screen reader announces expanded/collapsed, focus not trapped
- Motion: Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Color contrast: Pending audit next step
