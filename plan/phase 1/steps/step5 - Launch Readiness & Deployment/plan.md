# Step 5: Launch Readiness & Deployment

## Goal

Harden the product for launch. Ensure performance budgets, accessibility/compliance, SEO/meta and structured data, analytics coverage, deployment readiness, i18n coverage, and final testing/documentation are complete and validated.

## Scope

- Performance and budgets (build size, TTI, SSR hydration, Lighthouse)
- Accessibility and compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA focus areas, reduced motion, ARIA)
- SEO and metadata (Open Graph/Twitter, robots/sitemap, structured data validation)
- Analytics event catalog and QA (align with docs/05-analytics-tracking.md)
- Deployment and ops (Docker/SSR, NGINX, envs) per docs/06-deployment.md
- i18n coverage and content freeze (ES/EN)
- Final testing and documentation (VALIDATION_REPORT.md, COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md)

## Deliverables

- All quality gates green: build, lint, tests, budgets, Lighthouse targets met
- Accessibility and compliance checklist completed
- SEO/meta and structured data validated
- Analytics catalog finalized and documented
- Deployment runbook and configuration verified
- i18n coverage verified and content frozen
- Validation and compliance docs updated
