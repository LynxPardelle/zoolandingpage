# Test-Driven Development

Write the failing proof first, then write the smallest code that makes it pass.

## Default Scope In This Repo

Use this for:

- Angular services, route logic, and runtime behavior
- local tooling and authoring sync code
- sibling-Lambda behavior changes
- regressions that can be pinned to a reproducible command or route contract

Do not treat this as the default path for:

- draft JSON edits
- content-only changes
- docs-only changes

## Workflow

1. Define the failing proof first.

   - Add or update the narrowest test that demonstrates the intended behavior change.
   - If the area lacks an automated harness, create the smallest reproducible command or fixture before implementation.

2. Verify the proof fails for the right reason.

   - Confirm the failure matches the missing or broken behavior.
   - Fix the test if it fails for setup noise instead of the intended reason.

3. Write the minimal implementation.

   - Change only the code needed to satisfy the failing proof.
   - Avoid speculative helpers and unrelated cleanup.

4. Re-run the narrow proof.

   - Confirm the targeted test or reproduction now passes.

5. Run the smallest adjacent regression check.

   - Add one nearby test or focused verification step when the change could break adjacent behavior.

6. Refactor only after green.
   - Keep behavior unchanged while improving structure.

## Repo-Specific Guidance

- Pair this skill with `karpathy-guidelines` for scope control.
- For draft-affecting UI behavior, automated proof does not replace the required desktop and mobile browser QA closeout.
