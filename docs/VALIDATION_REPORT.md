- ✅ Clean separation between TypeScript logic and HTML templates

### 4. **Complete Type Safety**

- ✅ Added proper typing for all variables, including function-scoped variables
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with typed error objects
- ✅ Fixed theme service with proper TypeScript types
- ✅ All method parameters properly typed

### 5. **Foundation Components**

- ✅ **AppContainer**: Fixed input signals, added ThemeService integration
- ✅ **AppSection**: Fixed input signals, added ThemeService integration
- ✅ **AppHeader**: Complete with responsive navigation and HTML template
- ✅ **AppFooter**: Complete with responsive layout and HTML template
- ✅ All components follow atomic file structure (under 80 lines)

### 6. **Translation System Preparation**

- ✅ Created comprehensive translation files (en.json, es.json)
- ✅ Enhanced LanguageService with ngx-translate integration patterns
- ✅ Added browser language detection and proper state management

### 7. **Documentation Updates**

- ✅ Updated development guide with new mandatory requirements
- ✅ Added environment variable integration examples
- ✅ Updated component plan with new rules

## 🔄 Pending Items

### 1. **Package Installation**

- ❌ Need to install `@ngx-translate/core` and `@ngx-translate/http-loader`
- **Reason**: Docker environment not available in current setup
- **Status**: Translation structure ready, packages need installation when environment available

### 2. **Translation Activation**

- ❌ Uncomment TODO sections in LanguageService
- **Dependency**: Requires ngx-translate packages to be installed first

### 3. **Live Application Testing**

- ❌ Cannot test running application
- **Reason**: Node.js/npm not available in current environment
- **Status**: All code follows patterns, ready for testing when environment available

## 🎯 Compliance Status

### **MANDATORY Rules Compliance**

✅ **HTML Template Files Only**: All components use `templateUrl`
✅ **Complete Type Safety**: Everything typed including function variables
✅ **Environment Variables**: All services use environment configuration
✅ **Correct ngx-angora-css Methods**: Using `pushColors()` and proper methods
✅ **Types Only**: No interfaces or enums used
✅ **Atomic File Structure**: All files under 80 lines
✅ **Latest Angular Features**: Using signals, computed, new control flow
✅ **ThemeConfig Usage**: ThemeService uses proper ThemeConfig types

## 🚀 Ready for Task 2

### **Foundation Solid**

All foundation components are properly implemented and follow the new mandatory requirements. The codebase is ready to proceed with Task 2 (Content Components).

### **Architecture Established**

- ✅ Service pattern established (ThemeService, LanguageService)
- ✅ Component patterns established (atomic structure, proper typing)
- ✅ Environment integration pattern established
- ✅ ngx-angora-css usage patterns established

### **Quality Standards Met**

- ✅ All files follow atomic structure (under 80 lines)
- ✅ Complete type safety implemented
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns
- ✅ Environment-based configuration

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **When Environment Available**:

   - Install translation packages: `make install pkg="@ngx-translate/core @ngx-translate/http-loader"`
   - Activate translation TODOs in LanguageService
   - Test application functionality

2. **Immediate Next**:
   - Proceed with Task 2: Content Components
   - Apply same patterns established in foundation components
   - Continue following all mandatory requirements

## 🏆 Achievement Summary

**Task 1 Foundation Components**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

- All foundation layout components implemented
- All mandatory requirements followed
- Architecture patterns established
- Ready for next phase of development

The foundation is now rock-solid and ready for building upon!

## Step 5 Task 1 – Performance & Budgets

### Production Build Snapshot (2025-08-23)

- Initial browser total: ~636.44 kB (warn vs budget 500 kB)
- Initial transfer size (est.): ~170.68 kB
- Lazy chunks created: conversion-calculator (~12.4 kB), faq-section (~4 kB)
- anyComponentStyle warning: toast.component.scss exceeded by ~9 bytes

### Actions

- Deferred Conversion Calculator, FAQ, Interactive Process, and Testimonials with placeholders to move work off the initial path.
- Kept budgets as-is to drive further improvements; next iteration can target trimming styles and splitting non-critical modules.

### Next

- Consider deferring additional non-critical sections if needed, and/or tightening component styles.
- Run Lighthouse (mobile) and capture LCP/CLS/INP.
